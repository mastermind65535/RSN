# RSN
Restricted Secure Network

## Project Description
RSN (Restricted Secure Network) is a **TCP proxy-based secure network solution designed to provide restricted access management** in various networks that require high-security properties and robust capabilities.
It enables the creation of a secure intra-network within any network, providing VPN-like services with an enhanced, custom encryption layer to protect traffic and user data.
RSN can create protected intra-network inside any network using its authentication system or customized authentication systems by the managers.

The main objective of the previous RSN (Restricted Secure Network) project design was to **block unauthorized access to networks connected to IoT (Internet of Things) devices and to manage access for general users**.
It is a <ins>pre-prototype stage project aimed at developing a system that uses strict network access policies to block unauthorized access</ins> and enable safe connections for general users.

| **Secure Access Control**       | RSN offers secure access management, allowing network administrators to ***enforce strict policies for network access***.                                               |
| **Custom Encryption Layer**     | In addition to existing security protocols, RSN implements a custom encryption system, ensuring ***high-level protection of data transmitted across the network***.     |
| **Flexible Authentication**     | RSN ***supports secure authentication mechanisms such as NAS (Network Access Control)***, including customizable authentication systems.                                |
| **Secure Communication**        | RSN ensures that ***all communication within the intra-network is protected, offering the same level of security as a traditional VPN*** but with additional features.  |
| **Customizable Access Rules**   | Administrators can create stricted access policies, ***controlling which users or devices have access to specific resources or subnets*** within the protected network. |
